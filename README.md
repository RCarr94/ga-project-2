TT has one goal, to build a strong community of outdoor enthusiasts who can collectively create their own encyclopedia of trails where each user can create trails that haven't been shared yet, add their personal experiences to each trail they've hiked, and favourite the ones they loved or plan to hike.

- Option for users to reply to comments --> Chain
- Different tiers for users --> ex. only mods can delete trails that have been added
